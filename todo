?? turn property into bool-check list/numeric/currency/enum/binary/time/timeOffset/time-range/geography/geometry/image/guid/hierarchyid/file/external system(s) ids(including refids)
link files (how to upload files without storage limit restriction) [https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/calling.html https://www.mediafire.com/developers/sdks_and_tools/javascript/basics/ https://github.com/MediaFire/mediafire-csharp-open-sdk]
--disconnect linked node
Make a template for standard knowledge Graph, which will be default of tenant
Change Text color (on dark background harder to recognize text) - maaz suggestion
not overlap the nodes on top of each other - maaz suggestion
Admin user to have access of other graphs
convert to mobile (https://auth0.com/blog/converting-your-web-app-to-mobile/)
notification engine:mobile alarm,mobile notification,email

merge calendar events and todo???

to analyze
How to visualize information at run time
how to automated data entry at run time
import all contacts -> categorize them (work,family,neighbour,friend[association-gym,school],plumber(need to be more generic),misc acquaintance) ->map them to their Social media Acc-> Generate Knowledge Graph

to do?
 keep track of important notes, documents, voice recordings and external system references (e.g whatsapp chat quote or gmail email)
 add tasks (manual + automated)
 add events and trigger engine 
 turn property into bool/check list/Enum(define enum at graph or node level) 
 sequencing(may be drag/drop) of properties
 sequencing of nodes??
 tags= tag name+value
 calendar/schedular integration
 communicating with app via console integrate it with prolog/etc
 properties vs tasks (should actions be added like properties)

 declaration of processes???->notification(including absoltue start end,interval type,interval start end,interval delayed custom point)
 schedular
 reporter
 prioritizer
 information manipulator -  interface and non interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information

representing graph into n-d tabular info


event types? (onchange->time,place,person,action,state[key-value pair])
-app events->app start,app end, time interval increased(second,minute,hour,day,month,year),onerror
-system events - user logged in attempt(user id,isSuccess),logout,graph created,graph saved,graph opened,node added, node modified,node deleted, property added,property modified,property deleted,undo,redo,(link node?),edge added,edge modified,edge deleted etc
-bot events - ??

attach model(or function that does something?) that can predict or match person by image
should node have type i.e programming class
