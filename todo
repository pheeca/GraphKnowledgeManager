 add tasks (manual + automated)
 add events and trigger engine 
 sequencing(may be drag/drop) of properties

-app events->app start,app end, time interval increased(second,minute,hour,day,month,year),onerror
-system events - user logged in attempt(user id,isSuccess),logout,graph created,graph saved,graph opened,node added, node modified,node deleted, property added,property modified,property deleted,undo,redo,(link node?),edge added,edge modified,edge deleted etc
